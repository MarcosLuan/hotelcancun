# Hotel Cancun Project

Post-Covid scenario:
People are now free to travel everywhere but because of the pandemic, a lot of hotels went
bankrupt. Some former famous travel places are left with only one hotel.
You‚Äôve been given the responsibility to develop a booking API for the very last hotel in Cancun.

## üöÄ Starting

These instructions will allow you to get a working copy of the project on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### üìã Requirements

The application can be packaged using:
```shell script
./mvnw package
```
It produces the `quarkus-run.jar` file in the `target/quarkus-app/` directory.
Be aware that it‚Äôs not an _√ºber-jar_ as the dependencies are copi10ed into the `target/quarkus-app/lib/` directory.

The application is now runnable using `java -jar target/quarkus-app/quarkus-run.jar`.

If you want to build an _√ºber-jar_, execute the following command:
```shell script
./mvnw package -Dquarkus.package.type=uber-jar
```
The application, packaged as an _√ºber-jar_, is now runnable using `java -jar target/*-runner.jar`.
